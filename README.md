# Build-A-Road

Wrote an application that will take some map & terrain data, store this information as a graph and/or
tree structure, and use that to answer specific questions involving navigating from place to place. Did utilize popular libraries utiltizing graph functions nor STL containers. Everything was coded from scratch. The result was a Terrain file (.ply) generated from the HelperProgram and if you run it in MeshLab, you will see the roads built between the cities.
